# Agent2API · Multi-Provider Local Gateway

[简体中文](./README.md) | **English**

Wraps the login state of several AI desktop clients into a local **OpenAI-compatible API gateway**, exposing a single `base_url` and bundling multi-provider account management, model management (enable / disable / delete / alias), content redaction, egress proxying and request reporting — plus a ready-to-run Tauri desktop app. Any OpenAI client that accepts a custom `base_url` can call these providers' model quota through `http://127.0.0.1:3065/v1` — no API key, no client source changes needed.

The three chat entry points (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/messages`, plus `/v1/messages/count_tokens`) and `/v1/models` behave identically for every platform — the differences above are only about what each upstream can do. Model mapping, the global priority queue, 429 fallback, egress proxying, content redaction and request reporting apply to all platforms alike.

> **This project is for learning and discussion only.** It reuses the login state of your own accounts through a local reverse proxy; forwarding requests in the shape of a non-official client may violate the upstream services' terms of service, and any risk (including rate limiting or account bans) is borne by the user. Commercial use and circumventing billing are prohibited. See [Usage Notice](#usage-notice) and [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

> This is a personal, local-purpose proxy tool. It is unaffiliated with Tencent (WorkBuddy), Meituan (CatPaw), SenseTime (Raccoon), Zhipu (AutoClaw/autoglm), Alibaba Cloud (Qoder / Accio), Huawei Cloud (CodeArts), ByteDance (Trae), iFlytek (Loomy), Cline and their official products; every interface shape comes from observing each vendor's desktop client traffic, and upstream may change at any time.

## Quick Start

Download the installer from Releases (NSIS, Simplified Chinese, installs to `C:\Program Files\Agent2API` by default, and needs administrator approval during setup), then launch it — **no Node or any other runtime required**.

1. First launch starts the local gateway (port 3065) inside the app process and opens the main window. If an older version's data directory or data files are found, a dialog walks you through the migration.
2. Click "Add account" on the Accounts page, pick a provider (WorkBuddy / Raccoon / CatPaw / AutoClaw domestic / AutoClaw international / Qoder / Cline / Accio international / Accio domestic / ZCode domestic / ZCode international / CodeArts / Trae / Loomy), then sign in or fill in credentials using whatever that vendor supports: web login, SMS code, pasting credentials, or importing this machine's desktop login state (importing stores no token — the gateway follows once the desktop client signs in again; CodeArts and Trae only offer web login and pasted credentials; Loomy only offers SMS sign-in and pasted session).
3. Set your OpenAI client's `base_url` to `http://127.0.0.1:3065/v1` and put anything in `api_key` (for example `sk-local`; the server does not check it while authentication is disabled).

Closing the window only minimizes to the tray by default, and the gateway keeps forwarding in the background; to quit for real, right-click the tray icon and choose "Exit".

Accounts sit in one **global queue** and are tried in ascending priority order, skipping accounts that are disabled, are out of balance (configured as "skip" below the threshold in account settings), do not offer that model, or are in a rate-limit cooldown for that model; when an account hits a 429 on a model the request falls back to the next candidate, and only when every candidate is unavailable is the last real error passed through.

### Verification

Once the gateway is up, use curl to confirm connectivity (put any name that actually exists in `GET /v1/models` into `model`):

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3065/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:3065/v1/models

curl http://127.0.0.1:3065/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-v4.1-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"stream":true}'
```

Client example (Python SDK):

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:3065/v1", api_key="sk-local")
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-v4.1-flash",     # whichever provider owns it — see GET /v1/models
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

**Pages running in a browser** (a self-built web UI, a single-file frontend app, …) that call this endpoint with `fetch` will fail with "cannot connect to the API": the gateway surface does **not** answer CORS by default, so the preflight (OPTIONS) lands on the API-key check and gets a 401 (a cross-origin preflight never carries the `Authorization` header) and the real request is never sent. Two ways out: ① turn on "Security → Gateway CORS" in Settings — the gateway then answers exactly like the panel does (preflight allowed, responses carry `Access-Control-Allow-*` with origin `*`, effective immediately). Note the gateway is the surface that really forwards upstream and spends quota: with `*` and no API key configured, any web page could drive your local gateway, so configure a "Gateway Key" as well; ② make the page same-origin — run a small local static server that also reverse-proxies `/v1` to `127.0.0.1:3065`, which removes cross-origin entirely and needs no relaxation at all.

## Docker Deployment

```bash
docker run -d --name agent2api --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3065:3065 -v ./data:/data \
  aimodcc/agent2api:latest
```

Open `http://<host>:3065` in a browser — the first visit walks you through **registering the admin account**; log in and create an API key in the "Gateway Keys" page for your clients — `http://<host>:3065/v1` is the OpenAI-compatible endpoint (it refuses to forward until the first key exists, then recovers automatically). All state (SQLite database / config / logs) lives in the `./data` volume.

Compose users (this is the whole `docker-compose.yml`; images are published for amd64 and arm64):

```yaml
services:
  agent2api:
    image: aimodcc/agent2api:latest
    container_name: agent2api
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3065:3065"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

Environment variables (all optional — nothing needs to be preset):

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENT2API_ADMIN_USER` + `AGENT2API_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Preset the admin account & password (password in plain text, hashed automatically at startup). Leave unset to register in the panel |
| `AGENT2API_PANEL_PORT` | Serve the panel (UI + `/api/*`) on its own port; map only the main port publicly to keep the management plane internal (bind the panel port as `127.0.0.1:3066:3066`) |
| `AGENT2API_HOST` / `AGENT2API_PROXY_PORT` | Listen address (default `0.0.0.0`) / port (default `3065`) |
| `AGENT2API_ALLOW_NO_KEY` | Set to `1` to serve `/v1` without any key — private networks only |
| `AGENT2API_CAPTCHA_ENABLED` | Login-page human verification widget: `1` enabled (default), `0` disabled |

Build from source: clone the repo and run `docker compose up -d --build` (the image contains only the gateway and the panel, no Rust toolchain).

**Web panel capability notes** (all differences stem from having no local desktop client): web login (WorkBuddy / Qoder / Cline), SMS codes and pasted credentials work fully; AutoClaw / CatPaw / Accio / CodeArts / Trae web-login callbacks hit the machine's own port, so from a remote panel use pasted credentials instead; Raccoon web login and "import desktop login state" are unavailable (use pasted credentials; Loomy, CodeArts and Trae have no desktop login state to import either).

## Screenshots

### Accounts

Every provider's accounts share one **global queue** (the second column from the left is the priority) and can be toggled individually. The rate-limit row shows the per-model cooldown state and when it recovers, expiry is kept fresh by the "Credential maintenance" background task, and balance is refreshed per account on its own schedule (account settings dialog, "Query settings"; on by default, every 1 minute), and low-balance accounts are skipped below a threshold (default 1) by default — or can be disabled instead, or off.

![Accounts page: global queue, per-model rate-limit cooldown, expiry and balance](./assets/screenshots/accounts.png)

When adding an account you pick the provider first, then sign in however that vendor supports. One vendor can hold several account versions at once (WorkBuddy's China and Global editions, for example), and forwarding picks the right one by model name:

![Add account: choose provider and edition, then sign in on the web](./assets/screenshots/add-account.png)

### Report

The overview gives total requests, success rate, total tokens and the top model, with rankings by account and by provider beside it; below that come two usage donuts (by model and by provider), then a fixed 365-day activity heatmap:

![Report overview: stat cards, top accounts / providers, model and provider usage donuts](./assets/screenshots/report-overview.png)

Further down are the trends: the last 24 hours of **cache hit rate** (left axis, line) and **token consumption** (right axis, area) are overlaid in one chart so a dip in hit rate can be read as a change in traffic mix versus a cache miss; at the bottom is a per-day token bar chart whose range follows the time window at the top:

![Report trends: dual-axis cache hit rate and token consumption, per-day token bars](./assets/screenshots/report-trends.png)

### Scheduled Tasks

Background tasks are managed on one page: toggle, interval, last result and next fire time all live here, and you can also run one immediately without waiting out the interval. The task list itself is stored in the `scheduledTasks` field of `~/.agent2api/config.json`, and edits take effect immediately — no restart needed.

## Project Layout

Both the gateway and the desktop app live under `desktop-tauri/`: the backend is a Rust in-process HTTP server under `src-tauri/`, the frontend is plain HTML/CSS/JS under `ui/`.

## Development & Build

### Requirements

- Rust >= 1.77 and the Tauri 2 toolchain (to compile the desktop app itself; Windows also needs the WebView2 runtime)
- Node.js >= 18.17 (only to run `npm run tauri:*` and frontend build scripts such as `build/make-icon.mjs`; the desktop app does not depend on Node at runtime and ships no Node artifacts)

### Common scripts

```bash
npm run tauri:install      # Install desktop dependencies (same as npm --prefix desktop-tauri install)
npm run tauri:dev          # Launch the desktop app in dev mode (with hot reload)
npm run tauri:build        # Build the desktop installer

npm run build:icon         # Generate the icon source image (run after changing the icon design, then run tauri icon)
```

The root project has no runtime dependencies; `package.json` only provides the shortcut script entry points above. The build artifact is `target/release/bundle/nsis/Agent2API_<version>_x64-setup.exe` (currently about 3.0 MB; `src-tauri/.cargo/config.toml` points cargo's `target-dir` at the project root's `target/`).

## Usage Notice

### For learning and discussion only

This project is a hands-on exercise in HTTP reverse proxying, SSE streaming passthrough, multi-upstream protocol adaptation and desktop packaging (Tauri), and is **for personal learning and research only**. It is not an official product and has no affiliation with, endorsement from or sponsorship by Tencent and WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy, Meituan and CatPaw, SenseTime and Raccoon, Zhipu and AutoClaw / autoglm, Alibaba and Qoder / Accio, Huawei Cloud and CodeArts, ByteDance and Trae, or iFlytek and Loomy.

### About the reverse-proxy behaviour

What this project implements is a local reverse proxy: it reuses your own accounts' login state on your own machine and forwards requests to the official upstream gateways. It does not crack or bypass any payment or permission check — the quota it uses always comes from what your own account already has. That said, forwarding in the shape of a non-official client **may violate the upstream services' user agreements or terms of use**; whether to use it, and every consequence that follows (including but not limited to rate limiting, risk-control flags, account suspension or bans), is borne by the user.

### Prohibited uses

Do not use this project for any commercial purpose, for redistributing it for profit, for bulk account operation, for circumventing upstream billing or quota limits, or for any activity that violates local laws and regulations. To call these model services in production or commercial settings, use the official channels and official APIs.

### Credentials and data risk

This project stores account credentials (`accessToken` / `refreshToken`, etc.) as **plain text** in the local configuration directory (by default `~/.agent2api/`), and files produced by the export feature contain plain-text credentials as well. Keep them safe: never commit them to a public repository, upload them to cloud storage or share them with others. Losses caused by leaked credentials are borne by the user.

### No warranty and rights notice

## License

This project is released under the [MIT License](./LICENSE); you may use, modify and distribute it freely as long as the copyright notice is retained.

One caveat: the LICENSE file carries a **Usage Notice** after the MIT text, whose clause 3 **adds restrictions on top of** MIT (no commercial use, no reselling redistributions, no bulk account operation). This project is therefore **not** pure MIT — **the MIT terms and the Usage Notice together form the complete license**, and where the two reach different conclusions on the same act, the stricter one governs. That is also why `Cargo.toml` points `license-file` at the LICENSE file instead of declaring the SPDX identifier `"MIT"`.
